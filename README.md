Losing your furry friend is amongst the most heartbreaking things to experience as a pet owner. I
tâ€™s a time of stress and confusion, not knowing where to look or how to get the word out. 

On the other hand, as passers-by, if we see a little kitty caught in the rain, we might not know if its a pet or a street cat, and often just walk away doing nothing.

Pet Locator is an attempt at a one-stop app to bridge this gap, with lost pets being published, and sightings being reported, all on the same platform.
